    <h3>What is Feijao Tropeiro?</h3>
    <p>Feijao tropeiro originated from the brazilian nomadic vendors that would need <em>dried up</em> food
    that would not be easily perished. The ingredients would often be <em>beans, dried meat, bacon, cassava flour and salt.</em>
    Today it can vary from region to region (or even from family to family!), adding ingredients to the mix
    but the essential are always the same as before. It is costumarly accopanied by rice and today, I'll be sharing my family's way of doing it and it should take you a about an hour. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In case you don't find some of these ingredients, try to find a local brazilian market!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of <strong>Pinto Beans</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Brazilian Pork crackling</strong> to your liking (added after everything is done)</li>
        <li>1 cup of chopped <strong>bacon</strong></li>
        <li>1 cup of<strong>Smoked calabresa sausage</strong> (can be substituted by pepporoni sausages)</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of <strong>Garlic</strong> minced</li>
        <li>1 diced <stong>Onion</stong></li>
        <li>2 boiled eggs <strong>Egg</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 cup of diced <strong>parsley</strong> and <strong>chive</strong></li>
        <li>2 or 3 leaves of <strong>Cabbage</strong> thinly cut</li>
        <li>50g of <strong>Cassava flour</strong></li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to your liking</li>
        <li>(optional) 2/3 cup of fried plantains (not dried)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>The amount of ingredients can make it overwhelming for sure, but, making feijao tropeiro is basically 
        pre cooking and chopping up the ingredients, to in the end, add them all up in the pan and seasoning to your liking.
        Alright, let's get started. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cooking the beans on a pressure pan, for about 20 minutes of pressure time</li>
        <li>As the beans are finishing up, add to a large frying pan (a wok would work perfectly) the bacon and fry until browned.</li>
        <li>Set the bacon to the sides of the pan and add the sausage until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and garlic, mixing with the bacon and sausage</li>
        <li>By now the beans should be ready, so now add it to the pan with a little bit of its broth and let it sear for about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Now add the cassava powder, mixing it well and leaving it searing for another 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Finally, you can leave the fire on low and mix the rest of the ingredients, letting them reach the same temperature as the rest</li>
        <li>Season to your liking</li>
        <li>You're now done! Serve it while hot, accopanied by rice.</li>
    </ol>
